# OpenGPT

`OpenGPT` is an open-source _cloud-native_ large **multi-modal models** (LMMs) serving solution. 
It is designed to simplify the deployment and management of large language models, on a distributed cluster of GPUs.

> **Note**
> The content of `README.md` is just a placeholder to remind me of what I want to do.

## Features

OpenGPT provides the following features to make it easy to deploy and serve large multi-modal models (LMMs) in production:

- Support for multi-modal models
- Scalable architecture for handling high traffic loads
- Optimized for low-latency inference
- Automatic model partitioning and distribution across multiple GPUs
- Centralized model management and monitoring
- REST API for easy integration with existing applications

You can learn more about OpenGPT’s [architecture in our documentation](https://opengpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Roadmap

You can view our roadmap with features that are planned, started, and completed on the [Roadmap discussion](discussions/categories/roadmap) category.

## Installation

Install the package with pip:

```bash
pip install open_gpt_torch
```

## Quickstart

```python
import open_gpt

model = open_gpt.create_model('facebook/llama-7b', device='cuda', precision='fp16')

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

output = model.generate(
    prompt,
    max_length=100,
    temperature=0.9,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    repetition_penalty=1.2,
    do_sample=True,
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
```

We also provide some advanced features to allow you to host your models cost-effectively:

- **Offloading**: you can offload parts of the model to CPU to reduce the cost of inference.

- **Quantization**: you can quantize the model to reduce the cost of inference.

For more details, please see the [documentation](https://opengpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Serving Models

You can serve your models with OpenGPT. To do so, you can use the `serve` command:

```bash
opengpt serve facebook/llama-9b --device cuda --precision fp16 --port 5000
```

This will start a server on port 5000. You can then send requests to the server:

```python
import requests

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5000/generate",
    json={
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_length": 100,
        "temperature": 0.9,
        "top_k": 50,
        "top_p": 0.95,
        "repetition_penalty": 1.2,
        "do_sample": True,
        "num_return_sequences": 1,
    },
)


# SSE support
from aiohttp_sse_client import client as sse_client

async with sse_client.EventSource(
    'http://localhost:5000/stream/generate?prompt=The+quick+brown+fox+jumps+over+the+lazy+dog.&max_length=100&temperature=0.9&top_k=50&top_p=0.95&repetition_penalty=1.2&do_sample=True&num_return_sequences=1'
) as event_source:
    try:
        async for event in event_source:
            print(event)
    except ConnectionError:
        pass
```

Note that the server will only accept requests from the same machine. If you want to accept requests from other machines, you can use the `--host` flag to specify the host to bind to.

## Deploying Models

You can also deploy the server to a cloud provider like Jina Cloud or AWS.
To do so, you can use `deploy` command:

- Jina Cloud

```bash
opengpt deploy facebook/llama-9b --device cuda --precision fp16 --provider jina --name opengpt --replicas 2
```

- AWS

To deploy to AWS, you need to install extra dependencies: 

```bash
pip install opegpt[aws]
```

And you need to specify the region:

```bash
opengpt deploy facebook/llama-9b --device cuda --precision fp16 --provider aws --region us-east-1 --name opengpt --replicas 2
```

This will deploy the model to the cloud provider. You can then send requests to the server:

```python
import requests

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

response = requests.post(
    "https://opengpt.jina.ai/generate",
    json={
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_length": 100,
        "temperature": 0.9,
        "top_k": 50,
        "top_p": 0.95,
        "repetition_penalty": 1.2,
        "do_sample": True,
        "num_return_sequences": 1,
    },
)
```

## Kubernetes

To deploy OpenGPT on your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. Install the OpenGPT operator on your Kubernetes cluster using Helm:

    ```bash
    helm install opengpt ./helm/opengpt --namespace opengpt
    ```

2. Create a custom resource for your GPT model:
    
    ```YAML
    apiVersion: opengpt.io/v1alpha1
    kind: GptModel
    metadata:
      name: my-gpt-model
      namespace: opengpt
    spec:
      modelPath: s3://my-bucket/my-model
      modelName: my-model
      maxBatchSize: 16
      inputShape:
        - 1024
        - 1024
        - 3
      outputShape:
        - 1024
        - 1024
        - 3

    ```
   
3. Apply the custom resource to your cluster:

    ```bash
   kubectl apply -f my-gpt-model.yaml
    ```

4. Monitor the status of your GPT model using the OpenGPT dashboard:

    ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n opengpt svc/opengpt-dashboard 8080:80
    ```

## Accessing models via API

You can also access the online models via API. To do so, you can use the `inference_client` package:

```python
from inference_client import Client

client = Client(token='<your access token>')

model = client.get_model('facebook/llama-9b')

prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

output = model.generate(
    prompt,
    max_length=100,
    temperature=0.9,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    repetition_penalty=1.2,
    do_sample=True,
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
```

By this way, you can access the models without deploying them to your own machine.

## Advanced Usage

### Model Offloading

You can also apply the model offloading techniques (based on [FlexTensor](https://github.com/numb3r3/flex-tensor)) to OpenGPT. To do so, you can use the `--offload-percents` flag:

```bash
opengpt serve facebook/llama-9b --device cuda --precision fp16 --port 5000 --offload-percents 10,90,50,50,0,100
```

This will offload parts of the model to the CPU. You can also use the `--offload-strategy` flag to specify the offloading strategy:

```bash
opengpt serve facebook/llama-9b --device cuda --precision fp16 --port 5000 --offload-strategy "cpu,cpu,cpu,cpu,cpu,cpu"
```

### Model Quantization

You can also apply the model quantization techniques.

- 8-bit quantization

```bash
opengpt serve facebook/llama-9b --device cuda --precision fp16 --port 5000 --quantize 8bit
```

## Fine-tuning Models

We currently support fine-tuning models by using the `finetune` command:

```bash
opengpt finetune facebook/llama-9b --dataset wikitext-2 --device cuda --precision fp16 --batch-size 32 --learning-rate 1e-4 --epochs 10
```

Specifically, we implement the following fine-tuning methods:
- [LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of LLaMA](https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/LLaMA-Adapter): Fine-tuning model to follow instructions within 1 Hour and 1.2M Parameters
- [low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf): Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Language Model Fine-Tuning

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
