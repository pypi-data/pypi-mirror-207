**lazy-learn** is a high-level Python interface for automated machine learning (AutoML). While there are many AutoML libraries available each typically solves a niche area of the overall ML pipeline without providing a covering and approachable end-to-end system.

The aim of lazy-learn is exactly that. Given a dataset, easy-learn will analyse types and distributions of attributes, preprocess, feature-engineer and ultimately train models to be used for further evaluation or inference. 

## Usage

Using lazy-learn revolves around the `LazyLearner` class. You can think of it as a kind of project, and it is the wrapper for any experiment within lazy-learn.
