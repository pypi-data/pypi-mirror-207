# rulelearn (v0.1)

This package contains a rule induction toolkit to generate readable and editable rules from data. The code was originally released within the larger [AIX 360 package](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIX360) and is provided and extended here separately with less dependencies.


It contains the following components:

- Boolean Decision Rules via Column Generation (Light Edition) ([Dash et al., 2018](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7716-boolean-decision-rules-via-column-generation))
- Generalized Linear Rule Models ([Wei et al., 2019](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wei19a.html))
- Fast Effective Rule Induction (Ripper) ([William W Cohen, 1995](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.107.2612&rep=rep1&type=pdf))
- Relational Rule Network (R2N) ([Kusters et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06515))
- trxf - Technical Rule Interchange Format - Rule Set Interchange providing common evaluation tools and PMML export for 
rule sets.
