Trying to create my own enviornment and upload to github + pypi.  
In this version of environment, I am trying to change the reward function a little bit 
I am stil keeping the original reward function, but I am adding a new penalty funciton 
if the agent is below the 0.2 height, then it will give a penalty of negative 1. We will see what will happen.
