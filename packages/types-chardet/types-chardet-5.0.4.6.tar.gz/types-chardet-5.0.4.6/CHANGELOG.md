## 5.0.4.6 (2023-05-10)

Add `partial_stub` metadata field (#10157)

## 5.0.4.5 (2023-04-29)

chardet: UniversalDetector.feed accepts bytearray (#10107)

Technically it accepts any buffer, but the inline type annotations
now say bytes | bytearray, so let's stick to that.

Part of #9006

## 5.0.4.4 (2023-04-24)

Simplify `chardet` type imports (#10080)

## 5.0.4.3 (2023-03-27)

Add defaults for third-party stubs A-D (#9952)

## 5.0.4.2 (2023-02-21)

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.
