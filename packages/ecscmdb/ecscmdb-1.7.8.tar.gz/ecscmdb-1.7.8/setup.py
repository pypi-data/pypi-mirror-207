They are both\n    located in the directory etc/ecscmdb, which is relative to the\n    virtualenv directory ecscmdb was installed in.  The config files\n    can be in yaml, toml, or json formats.  Only yaml format will be\n    used in this documentation.  The two config files are cmdb.yml and\n    filter.yml.\n\n### cmdb.yml\n\n    cmdb.yml is a yaml file. The yaml file can have multiple "config" \n    sections defined within it.  There must be at lease one config section.\n    Each config secion has the following fields:\n    \n    name:       The name of the config section.\n\n    pw:         The location of the cmdb password file relative to \n                virtualenv base directory cmdb was installed in.\n\n    log_level:  The python log level cmdb will run at.  Must be one of \n                DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, or TRACE.\n\n    log_dir:    The location of the cmdb log directory relative to \n                virtualenv base directory cmdb was installed in. \n\n    OME_Login:  The User ID of the OpenManage server that will be used \n                to gather the data.\n\n    poolsize:   The number of python ProcessPoolExecutor pools that will\n                be used to gather the OpenManage data.\n\n    filter:     The location of the cmdb filter file.  The filter\n                file, explained in detail below, scans the incoming\n                OpenManage, and only stores the required columns and\n                rows of the data.  \n    \n    output:     The location of the cmdb output file that the cmdb \n                spreadsheet will be written to.  The name of the file can\n                include the jinja2 variable "{{ TOD }}" to include the \n                current date and time.\n\n    In addition to the config section(s), the yaml file also must include \n    the yaml variable "section:" which indicates which of the config sections\n    to process.\n\n### cmdb.yml example file\n```\nHere is an example cmdb.yml file with two config sections.  Because the\n"section:" variable is set to 2 in this example the second section, with \nname "Configuration file Testing", will be used.\n\n---\nsection: 2\nconfig:\n  - name: Configuration file Production.\n    pw: etc/ecscmdb/cmdb.pw\n    log_level: warning\n    log_dir: log\n    OME_Login: cmdb\n    poolsize: 12\n    filter: etc/ecscmdb/filter.yml\n    output: output/OpenManage-cmdb.{{ TOD }}.xlsx\n  - name: Configuration file Testing.\n    pw: etc/ecscmdb/cmdb.pw\n    log_level: TRACE\n    log_dir: log\n    OME_Login: cmdb\n    poolsize: 24\n    filter: etc/ecscmdb/filter.yml\n    output: output/OpenManage-test-cmdb.{{ TOD }}.xlsx\n...\n```\n\n### filter.yml\n\n    filter.yml is a yaml file. The yaml file can have multiple "config" \n    sections defined within it.  There must be at lease one config section.\n    Each config secion has the following fields:\n    \n    name:           The name of the config section.\n    \n    column_header:  The name of the column used to match the "row" labels.\n    \n    rename_columns: A dictionary of "Old Name": "New Name" used to rename\n                    Column lines.\n    \n    sort_columns:   A list of column names to sort the each worksheet with.\n    \n    filters:        A list of Row:Columns:Update to include from the \n                    OpenManage database into each created worksheet.  The\n                    Update option is optional.\n\t\n        Row:        The names of the row to look for matching columns in\n                    within the OpenManage database data.\n\t\n        Columns:    A list of matching Columns names for the given Row to\n                    include.\n\t\n        Update:     A dictional entry of "Column Name": "Function Name".\n                    If the Column Name is part of the data precented from\n                    the OpenManage database, then the cell for Row:Column\n                    will be modified using the Function Name provided.\n                    The Function is defined in the python library\n                    updatecells.py that is part of the ECScmdb packages.\n                    This should be the only python library that needs to\n                    be modified.\n\n    In addition to the config section(s), the yaml file also must\n    include the yaml variable "section:" which indicates which of the\n    config sections to process.\n\n### filter.yml example file\n```\nHere is an example filter.yml file with one config section.  Because the\n"section:" variable is set to 1 in this example the first section, with \nname "Partial", will be used.\n\n---\nsection: 1\nconfig:\n  - name: Partial\n    column_header: InventoryType\n    rename_columns:\n      Ports: "Mac Address"\n\n    sort_columns:\n      - InventoryType\n      - DeviceDescription\n      - DeviceName\n      - InstanceId\n      - NicId\n      - CapabilityType.CapabilityId\n      - CapabilityType.Description\n      - CapabilityType.IdOwner\n      - CapabilityType.Name\n      - DiskNumber\n      - DnsName\n      - EndDate\n      - EntitlementId\n      - Id\n      - IdOwner\n      - LicenseDescription\n      - LicenseType.LicenseId\n      - LicenseType.Name\n      - Name\n      - Number\n      - SasAddress\n      - SerialNumber\n      - ServiceTag\n      - SlotNumber\n      - SoldDate\n\n    filters:\n      -\n        row: serverProcessors\n        columns:\n          - InstanceId\n          - InventoryType\n          - ModelName\n          - NumberOfCores\n      -\n        row: serverFcCards\n        columns:\n          - DeviceDescription\n          - DeviceName\n          - InventoryType\n          - VirtualWwn\n          - VirtualWwpn\n          - Wwn\n          - Wwpn\n      -\n        row: serverOperatingSystems\n        columns:\n          - Hostname\n          - InventoryType\n          - OsName\n      -\n        row: serverArrayDisks\n        columns:\n          - BusType\n          - DiskNumber\n          - InventoryType\n          - MediaType\n          - ModelNumber\n          - SerialNumber\n          - Size\n      -\n        row: serverMemoryDevices\n        columns:\n          - DeviceDescription\n          - InstanceId\n          - InventoryType\n          - ManufacturerDate\n          - Name\n          - SerialNumber\n          - Size\n          - Speed\n          - TypeDetails\n      -\n        row: serverNetworkInterfaces\n        columns:\n          - InventoryType\n          - NicId\n          - Ports\n        update:\n          Ports: update_ports\n      -\n        row: chassisSlotsList\n        columns:\n          - DnsName\n          - InventoryType\n          - Model\n          - Name\n          - Number\n          - Occupied\n          - ServiceTag\n      -\n        row: chassisControllerList\n        columns:\n          - InventoryType\n          - Name\n      -\n        row: deviceManagement\n        columns:\n          - DnsName\n          - EndPointAgents\n          - InstrumentationName\n          - InventoryType\n          - IpAddress\n          - MacAddress\n          - ManagementId\n          - ManagementType.Description\n          - ManagementType.Name\n        update:\n          EndPointAgents: update_end_point_agents\n      -\n        row: nicInformation\n        columns:\n          - Description\n          - DeviceId\n          - InventoryType\n          - Ipv4_address\n          - Mac_address\n          - Subnet_mask\n...\n```\n\n### cmdb.pw\n    cmdb.pw is a python AES encripted password file.  It must contain the\n    following two entries: \n\n    1. A key that matches the OME_Login variable from the cmdb.yml\n       file. The value of the entry is the password for that user.\n\n    2. A key named "OMEHost" (case-sensitive string).  The value of\n       the entry is the URL for the OpenManage host.\n\n### Adding or updating an entry in the cmdb.pw file\n\n    Execute "cmdb --add=STRING", where STRING is the key to be created\n    or updated.  cmdb will then prompt for the value for the given\n    key.  The entries are encripted and stored in the cmdb.pw file.\n\n### Example \n\n    # cmdb --add=xyzzy\n    Enter password for user \'xyzzy\':\n    #\n\n### Deleting an entry from the cmdb.pw file\n\n    Execute "cmdb --delete=STRING", where STRING is the key to be\n    deleted.  The entries will be deleted without prompting.\n\n### Example\n\n    # cmdb --delete=xyzzy\n    #\n\n### List the keys or keys/values stored n the cmdb.pw file\n\n    Execute "cmdb --list" to list all of the keys in the cmdb.pw file,\n    or "cmdb --list --verbose" to list both the keys and the values\n    for each key.\n\n### Examples\n\n    # cmdb --list\n    # cmdb --list --verbose\n\n## cmdbdiff\n\n    Before cmdbdiff can be used to compare two OpenManage\n    spreadsheets, created using the cmdb command, the file\n    cmdbdiff.yml must be created.  This file is located in the\n    directory etc/ecscmdb, which is relative to the virtualenv\n    directory ecscmdb was installed in.\n\n### cmdbdiff.yml\n\n    cmdbdiff.yml is a yaml file. The yaml file can have multiple\n    "config" sections defined within it.  There must be at least one\n    config section in it.  In addition to the config section(s), the\n    yaml file also must include the yaml variable "section:" which\n    indicates which of the config sections to process.st be at lease\n    one config section.  Each config secion has the following fields:\n\n    name:                       The name of the configuration section \n                                (optional).\n    admin:                      The Admin managing cmdbdiff.\n        name:                   The Admin name.\n        email:                  The Admin email address.\n        phone:                  The Admin phone number.\n    log_level:                  The python log level cmdb will run at.  \n                                Must be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, \n                                CRITICAL, or TRACE.\n    log_dir:                    The location of the cmdb log directory \n                                relative to virtualenv base directory cmdb \n                                was installed in.\n    report:                     The location of the cmdbdiff report file \n                                that cmdbdiff writes to.  The name of the \n                                file can include the jinja2 variable \n                                "{{ TOD }}" to include the current date and \n                                time.\n    email:                      The email section indicates who should \n                                receive a copy of the cmdbdiff report.\n        subject:                The subject line of the report email.\n        from:                   The name and email address of the user \n                                sending the report.\n            name:               The sending name.\n            email:              The sending email address.\n        to:                     A list of zero or more "to" email addresses.\n            name:               The outgoing name.\n            email:              The outgoing email address.\n        cc:                     A list of zero or more "cc" email addresses. \n            name:               The outgoing name.\n            email:              The outgoing email address.\n        text:                   The text of the email that is sent.\n            with_changes:       The text of the email being if there are \n                                changes between the spreadsheets being \n                                checked.\n            without_changes:    The text of the email being if there are no \n                                changes between the spreadsheets being \n                                checked. \n\n    In addition to the config section(s), the yaml file also must include \n    the yaml variable "section:" which indicates which of the config sections\n    to process.\n\n### jinja2 variables used in the cmdbdiff.yml file\n\n```\nThere are several jinja2 variables that can be used in the cmdbdiff.yml \nconfiguration file.  Here is a list with a description of their values:\n\nTOD:            The current Date and Time.\nDATE:           The currect Date.\nTIME:           The current Time.\nHOST:           The Host name the report was generated on.\nVERSION:        The Version of the cmdbdiff program.\nSPREADSHEET1:   The name of the first spreadsheet being checked.\nWORKSHEETS1:    The number of Worksheets in the spreadsheet 1.\nSPREADSHEET2:   The name of the second spreadsheet being checked.\nWORKSHEETS2:    The number of Worksheets in the spreadsheet 2.\nREPORT:         The name of the report file (from config.report).\nADMINNAME:      The name of the cmdbdiff Admin (from config.admin.name).\nADMINEMAIL:     The email address of the cmdbdiff Admin (from \n                config.admin.email).\nADMINPHONE:     The phone number of the cmdbdiff Admin (from \n                config.admin.phone).\n```\n\n### cmdbdiff.yml example file\n\n```\nHere is an example cmdb.yml file with one config sections.
