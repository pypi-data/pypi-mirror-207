# Sparse Filter Convolution

Sparse Filter Convolution is a Python package that provides a PyTorch function to perform fast convolutions with sparse global filters. The package includes a CUDA-optimized implementation of the `sparse_unfold` function, which is used internally by the `sparse_filter_convolution` function to efficiently process the input data.

## Functionality

The main function provided by this package is `sparse_filter_convolution(signal, filter, k)`, which takes the following input arguments:

- `signal`: A 3D PyTorch tensor of shape `(batch_size, dim, seq_len)`, representing a batch of input signals.
- `filter`: A 2D PyTorch tensor of shape `(dim, seq_len)`, representing a global filter that is applied to the input signals.
- `k`: An integer, representing the number of top elements to be considered from the filter.

The function returns a 3D PyTorch tensor of shape `(batch_size, dim, seq_len)`, which is the result of applying the sparse filter convolution to the input signals.

In addition to the `sparse_filter_convolution` function, this package also provides a lower-level CUDA-optimized function `sparse_unfold(padded_signal, top_k_indices, n)`, which can be used independently if desired. This function takes a padded signal, the top k indices of the filter, and the length of the signal as input arguments, and returns a sparse unfolded signal as a 4D PyTorch tensor.

## Usage

To use the `sparse_filter_convolution` function in your code, simply import it from the `sparse_filter_convolution` package:

```python
from sparse_filter_convolution import sparse_filter_convolution
