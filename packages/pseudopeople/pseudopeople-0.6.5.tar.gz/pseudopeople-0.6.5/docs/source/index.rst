pseudopeople is a Python package that generates realistic simulated data about a
fictional United States population over multiple decades, for use in testing entity resolution (record linkage)
methods.

| üôà **Simulated**: These are made-up people! No need to worry about confidentiality.
| üìù **Versatile**: Generate multiple datasets about the same population: censuses, surveys, and administrative records.
| ‚úîÔ∏è **Verifiable**: Ground-truth unique identifiers are present in every dataset for checking link correctness.
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable**: Configure the levels of noise in each dataset.
| üí™ **Full-scale**: Supports generating datasets at the size of the real-life US population.

Pseudopeople is currently in a public beta release.
Things are still in flux!
If you notice any issues, please let us know `on GitHub <https://github.com/ihmeuw/pseudopeople/issues>`_.

Introduction
------------

The University of Washington IHME Simulation Science Team is excited to introduce pseudopeople, the Python package that simplifies Entity Resolution (ER) research and development.
This package generates large-scale, simulated population data according to specifications by the user, to replicate a range of complexities of real applications of probabilistic record linkage software.
With sensitive data often required for ER, accessing and testing new methods and software has been a challenge - until now.
Our innovative approach creates realistic, simulated data including name, address, and date of birth, without compromising privacy.

Our work builds on the success of previous data synthesis projects, such as
`FEBRL <http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Peter.Christen/Febrl/febrl-0.3/febrldoc-0.3/manual.html>`_,
`GeCO <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2505515.2508207>`_,
and `SOG <https://web.archive.org/web/20170830050229/http:/mitiq.mit.edu/ICIQ/Documents/IQ%20Conference%202009/Papers/3-B.pdf>`_,
while leveraging the power of our simulation platform `Vivarium <https://vivarium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to incorporate real, publicly-accessible data about the US population.
This allows us to model realistic household and family structures at scale, with relevant geographies.
We have created a simulation of the US population, including names and addresses, with defined types of data collection (e.g., simulating decennial censuses, surveys, taxes, and other administrative data).
By creating realistic, but simulated, data which includes these attributes, we can make ER research and development easier for ourselves and others.

.. _quickstart:

Quickstart
----------

pseudopeople requires a version of `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ between 3.7 and 3.10 (inclusive) to be installed.
Once Python is installed, you can install pseudopeople with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ by running the command:

.. highlight:: console

::

   $ pip install pseudopeople

Or, you can install from source on `the pseudopeople GitHub repository <https://github.com/ihmeuw/pseudopeople>`_.

Then, generate a small-scale simulated decennial census:

::

   $ python

.. highlight:: pycon

::

   >>> import pseudopeople as psp
   >>> census = psp.generate_decennial_census()
   >>> census
        simulant_id first_name middle_initial  last_name age date_of_birth street_number           street_name unit_number     city state zipcode relation_to_reference_person     sex race_ethnicity

The simulated people in these datasets are called "simulants."
Both datasets have a :code:`simulant_id` column that uniquely identifies an individual.
The unique :code:`simulant_id` present in both datasets provides us with a truth deck,
which we wouldn't have for a linkage task with real, sensitive data.

::

   >>> true_matches = len(set(census.simulant_id) & set(taxes.simulant_id))
   >>> print(f"There are {true_matches:,} true matches to find between these datasets!")
   There are 6,181 true matches to find between these datasets!

Now, see how many your record linkage method can find -- without access to the truth deck, of course!

Not linking in Python?
Just save your datasets as files, for example CSV files:

::

   >>> census.to_csv('census.csv')
   >>> taxes.to_csv('taxes.csv')

Now you can load these datasets in any environment that can read CSV.

What's next?
------------

Now that you've generated a simulated dataset with pseudopeople,
here are some next steps:


* To get started with customizing the noise in your datasets,
  try out the :ref:`tutorial on configuring noise <tutorial_configuring_noise>`.
* To learn more about the kinds of simulated datasets that are available,
  check out our :ref:`Datasets page <datasets_main>`.
* If you need larger datasets with millions instead of thousands of rows,
  take a look at the :ref:`Input Data page <input_data_main>`.
* To dive deeper into noise, read the docs about :ref:`noise <noise_main>` and
  :ref:`noise configuration <configuration_main>`.
