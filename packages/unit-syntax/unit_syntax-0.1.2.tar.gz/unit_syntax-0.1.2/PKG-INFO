`unit-syntax` extends the Python language in Jupyter/IPython to support expressions with physical units:

```python
>>> speed = 5 meters/second
>>> 2 seconds * speed
10 meter
```

Behind the scenes this is translated into standard Python that uses the excellent [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/) units library.

## Getting Started

Install the package:

```shell
$ pip install unit-syntax
```

To enable unit-syntax in a Jupyter/IPython session run:

```python
import unit_syntax
unit_syntax.enable_ipython()
```

Note: in Jupyter this must be run in its own cell before any units expressions are evaluated.

## Usage

[An interactive notebook to play around with units](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PInyLGZHnUzEuUVgMsLrUUNdCurXK7v1#scrollTo=JszzXmATY0TV)

Units apply to the preceding value (a literal, variable, function call or indexing), and have higher precedence than other operators:

```python
x * 1.21 gigawatts
```

This is equivalent to `x * (1.21 gigawatts)`, and desugars to something like `x * Quantity(1.21, "gigawatts")`. The high precedence means units apply to the literal not the whole expression.

Values can be converted to another measurement system:

```python
(88 miles / hour) furlongs / fortnight
```

Pint transparently [supports numpy](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/numpy.html) when available:

```python
velocity = [5, 7] meters/second**2
location = velocity * 2 seconds
distance_traveled = numpy.linalg.norm(location)
```

## The Grammar

The units term follows this grammar:

```
units:
    | NAME '/' units_group
    | NAME '*' units_group
    | NAME units_group
    | NAME '**' NUMBER
    | NAME

units_group:
    | '(' units ')'
    | units
```

## Why? How?

I like using Python+[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) as a calculator for physical problems and often wish it had the clarity and type checking of explicit units. [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/) is great, but (IMO) its necessary verbosity makes it hard to see the underlying calculation that's going.

`unit-syntax` is an IPython/Jupyter [custom input transformer](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/inputtransforms.html) that rewrites expressions with units into calls to `pint.Quantity`. The parser is a lightly modified version of the Python grammar using the same parser generator ([pegen](https://github.com/we-like-parsers/pegen)) as Python itself.

`unit-syntax` cannot (currently) be used for standalone python scripts outside of IPython/Jupyter, but that's in principle possible through [meta_path import hooks](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-meta-path).

The syntax takes advantage of the fact that that in python its illegal for a NAME to follow a "primary" (literal, function call etc), so there's no ambiguity.

## Prior Art

The immediate inspriration of `unit-syntax` is a language called [Fortress](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.180.6323&rep=rep1&type=pdf) from Sun Microsystems. Fortress was intended as a modern Fortran, and had first-class support for units in both the syntax and type system.

F# (an OCaml derivative from Microsoft) also [has first class support for units](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Units_of_Measure).

The Julia package [Unitful.jl](http://painterqubits.github.io/Unitful.jl/stable/)

## Open questions and future work

- Fortress uses an `in` operator to apply units to a non-literal value, e.g `x in meters`. This has the advantage of being unambiguous regardless of parenthesization. In python this would conflcit with `value in [a, b, c]`, but `as` is

- Move to tree-sitter, which will be simpler and has a chance of providing syntax highlighting
- Test against various ipython and python versions
- Support standalone scripts through sys.meta_path
- Check units at parse time
- Unit type hints, maybe checked with [@runtime_checkable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.runtime_checkable). More Pint typechecking [discussion](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/issues/1166)
- Pint does not do the right thing when applied to generator expressions, e.g `(a for a in range(0, 4)) meters`
- Demo colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PInyLGZHnUzEuUVgMsLrUUNdCurXK7v1#scrollTo=JszzXmATY0TV
- Describe parsing ambuguity like `1 meters * sin(45 degrees)`
- Figure out story around parenthesization

## Development

To regenerate the parser:

`python -m pegen grammar.txt -o unit_syntax/parser.py`

Running tests:

```
 $ poetry install --with dev
 $ poetry run pytest
```

## Future work and open questions

- Parenthisized units expressions
- Demo colab notebook
- Move to tree-sitter so there's a chance of getting syntax highlighting
- Jupyter syntax checks
- Typography of output
- Test against various ipython and python versions
- Support standalone scripts through sys.meta_path
- Check units at parse time
- Unit type hints, maybe checked with [@runtime_checkable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.runtime_checkable). More Pint typechecking [discussion](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/issues/1166)
- Does not do the right thing when applied to generator expressions, e.g `(a for a in range(0, 4)) meters`
