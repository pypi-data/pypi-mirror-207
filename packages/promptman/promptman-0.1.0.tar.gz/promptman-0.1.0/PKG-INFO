# Prompt Man

> Package for prompting AI models.

***Prompt Man*** introduces the concept of "prompt functions", which is an alternative method for manual prompt engineering.

* Useful in making API calls to AI models.
* Makes prompt engineering more templetized.
* Useful for AI devs who don't want to bother too much about prompt engineering.

**Current version includes prompt functions that have been tested on the following AI models:**

- Language models :

  - ChatGPT (both 3.5 and 4)
  - StableLM 7B
- Image models :

  - Stable Diffusion
  - Dall-E 2

The github repo contains an `api` folder which includes scripts for api calls that can be used by just plugging in your API key.
