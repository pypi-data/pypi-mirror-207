# Multi-purpose PDF parser

This parser was designed keeping in mind requirement for parsing PDFs file to streamline fine tuning process of Large Language Models such as Open AI's GPT models.

## Functionalities:

- PDF file to Text File conversion
- PDF file to JSON file conversion
- PDF file to JSONL file conversion

## How to use?

1. PDF file to Text File conversion.

    You can use command ```pdfparser pdftotext INPUT_PDF_FILE_PATH -o OUTPUT_TEXT_FILE_PATH``` to make a copy of contents in your PDF file in a TEXT file of your own choosing.

2. PDF file to JSON File conversion.

    You can use command ```pdfparser pdftojson INPUT_PDF_FILE_PATH -o OUTPUT_TEXT_FILE_PATH``` to make a copy of contents in your PDF file in a JSON file of your own choosing. The JSON file will be in format ```{'text':PDF_CONTENTS}```.

1. PDF file to JSONL File conversion.

    This utility will prove quite helpful if you want to process a question answer data file into JsONL file to process it as source data for various Large Language Model's operations.
    You can use command ```pdfparser pdftojsonl INPUT_PDF_FILE_PATH -o OUTPUT_TEXT_FILE_PATH``` to extract question-answer pairs from your PDF file and save it in a separate JSONL file.

    Input file format: Your question answer pairs in PDF should be in ```Question: What is a cat? Answer: Cat is an animal```. New line separator will not affect the parser at all.
    Output format: A jsonl file in structure similar to ```[{'prompt':Question, 'completion':Answer}]``` format.
