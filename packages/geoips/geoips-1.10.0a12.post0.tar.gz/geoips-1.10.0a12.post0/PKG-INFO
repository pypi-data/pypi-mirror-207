GeoIPS Base Package
====================

The GeoIPS Base Package provides a Python 3 based architecture supporting a wide variety of
satellite and weather data processing. The modular nature of the GeoIPS base infrastructure also allows
plug-and-play capability for user-specified custom functionality.

Installation
------------
See the
[installation guide](./docs/source/starter/installation.rst)
within the source code documentation for installation instructions. GeoIPS has a fully supported
exhaustive installation process, including a full conda environment, as well as a more basic
pip based installation for "expert" users.

Creating your own GeoIPS Plugin
-------------------------------

See the instructions to
[setup a new plugin](./docs/source/devguide/dev_setup.rst)
if you are interested in creating your own functionality using the GeoIPS
infrastructure.

Contributing
-------------
Are you interested in
1. Notifying the geoips team of bugs?
2. Submitting a fix to a known bug?
3. Contributing new functionality to the main geoips code base?
4. Creating your own geoips-compatible plugin?

We welcome all feedback and contributions!

Please review our
[contributors guide](./docs/source/devguide/contributors.rst)
for more information.
