# solarkit - BPhO Computational challenge
## A tool to easily visualise and perform calculation on a solar system. The solutions for all challenges are embed but also provides the tools to tinker around and build new, original simulations

It was built as the first part of a two part subimission for the challenge. My idea is to create a website using django to allow anyone to use the simulation. Having this package will ensure clean, backend code that will do the work in just a couple of lines.

### Challenges
* Visualise a solar system
* Visualise the solar system, animated
* Spinograph
* Heliocentric model

### Personal aditions
* Tools to create, save & load a custom solar system
* Save the model output to an image
* Spinograph, animated

### How to use
1. pip install solarkit
