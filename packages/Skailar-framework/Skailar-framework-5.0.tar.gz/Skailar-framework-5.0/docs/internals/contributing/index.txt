Contributing to Skailar
======================

Skailar is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either
on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

Work on the Skailar framework
============================

The work on Skailar itself falls into three major areas:

**Writing code** üíª
    Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
    code** in the next version of Skailar!

    Start from the :doc:`writing-code/index` docs.

**Writing documentation** ‚úçÔ∏è
    Skailar's documentation is one of its key strengths. It's informative
    and thorough. You can help to improve the documentation and keep it
    relevant as the framework evolves.

    See :doc:`writing-documentation` for more.

**Localizing Skailar** üó∫Ô∏è
    Skailar is translated into over 100 languages - There's even some
    translation for Klingon?! The i18n team is always looking for translators
    to help maintain and increase language reach.

    See :doc:`localizing` to help translate Skailar.

If you think working *with* Skailar is fun, wait until you start working *on*
it. Really, **ANYONE** can do something to help make Skailar better and greater!

============================

We're passionate about helping Skailar users make the jump to contributing
members of the community. There are several other ways you can help the
Skailar community and others to maintain a great ecosystem to work in:

* Join the `Skailar forum`_. This forum is a place for discussing the Skailar
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Skailar.

* Join the |skailar-users| mailing list and answer questions. This
  mailing list has a huge audience, and we really want to maintain a
  friendly and helpful atmosphere. If you're new to the Skailar community,
  you should read the `posting guidelines`_.

* Join the `Skailar Discord server`_ or the `#skailar IRC channel`_ on
  Libera.Chat to discuss and answer questions. By explaining Skailar to other
  users, you're going to learn a lot about the framework yourself.

* Blog about Skailar. We syndicate all the Skailar blogs we know about on
  the `community page`_; if you'd like to see your blog on that page you
  can `register it here`_.

* Contribute to open-source Skailar projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Skailar, help us
  build it!

We're looking forward to working with you. Welcome aboard! ‚õµÔ∏è
