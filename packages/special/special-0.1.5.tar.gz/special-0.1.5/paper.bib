	abstract = {I describe our team's development of the SpeX Prism Library Analysis Toolkit (SPLAT), a combined spectral data repository for over 2500 low-resolution spectra of very low-mass dwarfs (late M, L and T dwarfs), and a Python-based analysis toolkit. SPLAT was constructed through a collaborative, student-centred, research-based model with high school, undergraduate and graduate students and regional K-12 science teachers. The toolkit enables spectral index analysis, classification, spectrophotometry, atmosphere model comparisons, population synthesis, and other analyses. I summarise the current components of this code, sample applications, and future development plans.},

@article{Mukherjee:2006,
	abstract = {The abundance of cosmological data becoming available means that a wider range of cosmological models are testable than ever before. However, an important distinction must be made between parameter fitting and model selection. While parameter fitting simply determines how well a model fits the data, model selection statistics, such as the Bayesian evidence, are now necessary to choose between these different models, and in particular to assess the need for new parameters. We implement a new evidence algorithm known as nested sampling, which combines accuracy, generality of application, and computational feasibility, and we apply it to some cosmological data sets and models. We find that a five-parameter model with a Harrison-Zel'dovich initial spectrum is currently preferred.},

@article{Feroz:2009,
	abstract = {We present further development and the first public release of our multimodal nested sampling algorithm, called MULTINEST. This Bayesian inference tool calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. The developments presented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in Feroz &amp; Hobson, which itself significantly outperformed existing Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla Î› cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. It will also be released as part of the SUPERBAYES package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories of particle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org.},

	abstract = {Nested sampling (NS) computes parameter posterior distributions and makes Bayesian model comparison computationally feasible. Its strengths are the unsupervised navigation of complex, potentially multi-modal posteriors until a well-defined termination point. A systematic literature review of nested sampling algorithms and variants is presented. We focus on complete algorithms, including solutions to likelihood-restricted prior sampling, parallelisation, termination and diagnostics. The relation between number of live points, dimensionality and computational cost is studied for two complete algorithms. A new formulation of NS is presented, which casts the parameter space exploration as a search on a tree. Previously published ways of obtaining robust error estimates and dynamic variations of the number of live points are presented as special cases of this formulation. A new on-line diagnostic test is presented based on previous insertion rank order work. The survey of nested sampling methods concludes with outlooks for future research.},

	abstract = {emcee is a Python library implementing a class of affine-invariant ensemble samplers for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This package has been widely applied to probabilistic modeling problems in astrophysics where it was originally published, with some applications in other fields. When it was first released in 2012, the interface implemented in emcee was fundamentally different from the MCMC libraries that were popular at the time, such as PyMC, because it was specifically designed to work with "black box" models instead of structured graphical models. This has been a popular interface for applications in astrophysics because it is often non-trivial to implement realistic physics within the modeling frameworks required by other libraries. Since emcee's release, other libraries have been developed with similar interfaces, such as dynesty (Speagle 2019). The version 3.0 release of emcee is the first major release of the library in about 6 years and it includes a full re-write of the computational backend, several commonly requested features, and a set of new "move" implementations.},

	abstract = {We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman &amp; Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to âˆ¼N<SUP>2</SUP> for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at <A href="http://dan.iel.fm/emcee">http://dan.iel.fm/emcee</A> under the GNU General Public License v2.},

@article{Allers:2007,
	abstract = {We present near-infrared (1.0-2.4 Î¼m) spectra confirming the youth and cool temperatures of six brown dwarfs and low-mass stars with circumstellar disks toward the Chamaeleon II and Ophiuchus star-forming regions. The spectrum of one of our objects indicates a spectral type of ~L1, making it one of the latest spectral type young brown dwarfs identified to date. Comparing spectra of young brown dwarfs, field dwarfs, and giant stars, we define a 1.49-1.56 Î¼m H<SUB>2</SUB>O index capable of determining spectral type to +/-1 subtype, independent of gravity. We have also defined an index based on the 1.14 Î¼m sodium feature that is sensitive to gravity, but only weakly dependent on spectral type. Our 1.14 Î¼m Na index can be used to distinguish young cluster members (Ï„&lt;~5 Myr) from young field dwarfs, both of which may have the triangular H-band continuum shape that persists for at least tens of Myr. Using T<SUB>eff</SUB> values determined from the spectral types of our objects along with luminosities derived from near and mid-infrared photometry, we place our objects on the H-R diagram and overlay evolutionary models to estimate the masses and ages of our young sources. Three of our sources have inferred ages (Ï„~=10-30 Myr) that are significantly older than the median stellar age of their parent clouds (1-3 Myr). For these three objects, we derive masses ~3 times greater than expected for 1-3 Myr old brown dwarfs with the bolometric luminosities of our sources. The large discrepancies in the inferred masses and ages determined using two separate, yet reasonable, methods emphasize the need for caution when deriving or exploiting brown dwarf mass and age estimates.},
