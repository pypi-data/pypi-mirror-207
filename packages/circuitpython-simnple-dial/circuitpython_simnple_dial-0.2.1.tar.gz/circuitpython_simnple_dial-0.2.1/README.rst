A dial gauge widget for displaying graphical information. Derived from Dial made by Kevin Matocha. Main Differences:

    * Dial is a complete circle
    * Needle is a line. This line could be full or half
    * Needle size could be shortened using the pad option
    * Can have more than one needle.
    * Minor ticks can have their own labels

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install simple_dial

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Usage Example
=============
