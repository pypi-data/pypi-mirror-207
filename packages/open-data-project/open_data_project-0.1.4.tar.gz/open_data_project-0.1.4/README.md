# Open_data_project goal
Open_data_project is created and based upon the structure of the_od_bods repository of Open Data Scotland.
Its goal is to help developers launch their new open data portals using the data scraping functions. It also provides a command that launches the whole structure of the open data portal by also downloading the front-end package necessary for the website of it.
