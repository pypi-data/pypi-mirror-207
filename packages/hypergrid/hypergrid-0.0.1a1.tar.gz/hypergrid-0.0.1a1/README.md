# hypergrid

Hypergrid is designed to enable concise declaration and manipulation of parameter grids possible, which are often required when tuning ML hyperparameters or defining large batch jobs.

Hypergrid allows you to easily define multi-dimensional parameter grids, and then combine them in various ways, including sum-types, product-types, and co-iteration.  Once defined, you can easily map, filter, select, and apply arbitrary functions in order to easily compose and iterate over your grid.
