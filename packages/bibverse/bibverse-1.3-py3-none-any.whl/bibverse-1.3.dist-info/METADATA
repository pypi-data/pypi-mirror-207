# bibverse
A simple CLI program to quote the bible verse of the day from [Verse of the Day](https://www.verseoftheday.com/).

# Usage

Just type `bibverse` on the command line once the package has been installed, and you'll get the verse of the day.

# Installation

Installing the package is simple, just run `pip install bibverse` and make sure the binary is on your path. Once that's done, it's as simple as running the program and getting the verse of the day. Since the output is text, you could even pipe it to other programs like cowsay!
