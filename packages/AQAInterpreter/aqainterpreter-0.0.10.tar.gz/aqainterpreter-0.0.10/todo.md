now:
- [X] remove extra pseudo-code in testing section copied from `test_.py` file, instead but dump of `test_.py` in it the testing section and screenshot of `pytest AQAinterpreter --verbose` showing passing tests.

In holidays:
- [ ] look into python lark
- [ ] rewrite in rust and compile to wasm
- [ ] Add optional `:` in FOR loop
- [ ] add functions, classes, rewrite in another language
- [ ] add arrays
- [ ] make a transpiler to python
- [ ] make parser match Var() if so then do `_var_decl()` instead of looking ahead for ASSIGNMENT token
- [ ] switch to vite instead of importing files locally
