Python Preface
==============

**preface** is a set of basic utility functions that I'd like to be global in Python, and some utility types.
Stuff like getting any element from a set, flattening a list, etc.

These functions should be appropriately named but also not conflict with other names in the global space.

The name is a joke based on Haskell's prelude.

There is also a SumType that's useful for defining Python enums is an easier manner.
