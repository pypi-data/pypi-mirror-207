# MxOps

MxOps is a python package created to automate MultiversX transactions: be it smart contracts deployments, calls, queries or just simple transfers. Inspired from DevOps tools and built on top of [mxpy](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-py-cli), it aims to ease and make reproducible any set of these interactions with the blockchain.

MxOps aims to be useful in these situations:

- deployment automation
- on-chain integration tests
- contract interaction automation
