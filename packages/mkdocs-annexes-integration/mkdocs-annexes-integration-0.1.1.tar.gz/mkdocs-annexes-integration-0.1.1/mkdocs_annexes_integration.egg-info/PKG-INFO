Description: # mkdocs-annexes-integration
        
        This is a plugin that transforms annex files into images to be integrated in Markdown pages for MkDocs.
        
        ## Setup
        
        ### Before installing
        
        Before installing this plugin you need to install `poppler-utils` as it is used by `pdf2image` that is required to use this plugin.
        
        #### Install on Linux :
        
        Note: *It depend on your Linux OS*
        
        ``` sh
        sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
        ```
        
        ``` sh
        sudo yum install poppler-utils
        ```
        
        #### Install on MacOS :
        
        ``` sh
        brew install poppler
        ```
        
        #### Install on Windows :
        
        On Windows, you can download the latest binary release of Poppler from the official website and extract the files to a folder. Then, add the folder to the system's PATH environment variable.
        
        ### Installing using pip:
        
        `pip install mkdocs-annexes-integrations`
        
        ## Config
        
        You need to activate the plugin in `mkdocs.yml`:
        
        ```yaml
        plugins:
          - annexes-integrations:
            - annexes: # Required (at least 1)
              - Title of the annex A1: path/A/to/an/annex1.pdf # An path to an annex with it's title
              - Title of the annex A2: path/A/to/an/annex2.pdf # Another path to an annex in same folder as the first
              - Title of the annex B1: path/B/to/an/annex1.pdf # Another path to an annex but in different folder as the first two
              - Title of the annex C1:
                  src: ../src/path/C/to/an/annex1.pdf
                  dest: dest/path/C/to/an/annex1.pdf
              # ...
            - temp_dir: "folder_name" # Optional --> Default : temp_annexes
        ```
        
        As you can see, there are two possible ways to integrate an annex: using a simple path or a source path and a destination path. Both paths need to be relative to 'docs_dir', though.
        
        Set at least on annex to use this plugin. If you don't have any annex don't add this plugin to the mkdocs plugins list in config file mkdocs.yml
        
        - `annexes` - A list of all the annexes documents. The path from docs_dir to an annex file associated to it's title
        - `temp_dir` - The temp directory used to generate markdown file for each annex before rendering to HTML. Only set this option if you already have a temp_annexes folder in the root directory (same as mkdocs.yml), which, you should not normally.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Using the command `mkdocs build` or `mkdocs serve` will trigger the plugin if it as been set correctly in config file.
        
        This plugin is intended to be used with `mkdocs-with-pdf` plugin but can be used as it is.
