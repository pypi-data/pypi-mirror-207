rnginline is a Python library and command-line tool for loading multi-file RELAX
NG schemas from arbitary URLs, and flattening them into a single RELAX NG
schema.

## Features

- Convert multi-file RNG schemas into one file **without breaking or
  restructuring the schemas**
  - Great care is taken to maintain the semantics of the separate schema files
    in the single output
  - The input documents are changed as little as possible, so the output is as
    readable as the input
- Load schemas from:
  - The filesystem
  - From a Python package's data (without unpacking it to the filesystem)
  - Any type of URL by writing your own
    [UrlHandler](https://github.com/h4l/rnginline/blob/main/rnginline/urlhandlers.py)
- Command-line interface & Python API
- Test suite covering lots of edge cases, e.g. namespace handling
  - 100% line & branch code coverage

## Quickstart

Install with pip (or [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) if you only need the
command-line program):

```console
$ pipx install rnginline
```

You can use it from the command line like this:

```console
$ rnginline my-nested-schema-root.rng flattened-output.rng
```

You can use it from Python like this:

```python
>>> import rnginline
>>> rnginline.inline('my-nested-schema-root.rng')
<lxml.etree.RelaxNG object at ...>
```

You can load a multi-file schema from a Python package's data like this:

```python
>>> import rnginline
>>> from rnginline.urlhandlers import pydata
>>> url = pydata.makeurl('rnginline.test',
...                      'data/testcases/external-ref-1/schema.rng')
>>> url
'pydata://rnginline.test/data/testcases/external-ref-1/schema.rng'
>>> rnginline.inline(url)
<lxml.etree.RelaxNG object at ...>
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at http://rnginline.readthedocs.org/

## Motivation

`lxml` has good support for using RELAX NG schemas, but lacks support for
loading multi-file schemas from anywhere other than the filesystem. This is a
problem if you wish to bundle a multi-file schema with your Python
package/module. You'd have to depend on setuptools being available to use its
[resource extraction], or use one of the existing RELAX NG merging tools to
convert your schema into a single file.

[resource extraction]:
  https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/pkg_resources.html#resource-extraction

## Existing RELAX NG flattening tools

The following projects didn't quite fit my needs, leading me to write rnginline.
They may work for you though.

- [rng2srng](http://kohsuke.org/relaxng/rng2srng/) — Implements full
  simplification, so the structure of the input schema will be lost
- [rng-incelim](http://ftp.davidashen.net/incelim/) — A similar project to this,
  implemented in XSLT. Unfortunately doesn't handle namespace declarations on
  `<include>` elements correctly. XSLT 1.0 doesn't support creating namespace
  nodes, so to fix this rng-incelim would have to resolve all QNames in the
  schema to NCNames with ns attributes, which would be undesirable for me.

## Developing

Instructions for developers working on this project are in
[DEVELOPING.md](https://github.com/h4l/rnginline/blob/main/DEVELOPING.md).
