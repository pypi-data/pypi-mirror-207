pycompete provides tools to support the training and evaluation of models for the [CrunchDAO competition](https://www.crunchdao.com/).

## Installing pycompete

`pip install pycompete`

## Interacting with the CrunchDAO tournament

We recommend using the open-source [CrunchDAO Python](https://github.com/uuazed/crunchdao/tree/main) API for pulling data and submitting predictions.

To interact with the API, you need set your API key as the `CRUNCH_API_KEY` environment variable:

`export CRUNCH_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to raise a PR adding any functionality you think may be useful to other CrunchDAO competitors. If you find a bug please raise an issue and we will try and address.
