# XML import

You can convert any XML source into TF by specifying a few details about the source.

Text-Fabric then invokes the `tf.convert.walker` machinery to produce a Text-Fabric
dataset out of the source.

!!! caution "As an example"
    This is more intended as an example of how to tackle the conversion
    of XML to TF than as a production engine.
    Most XML corpora use elements for special things, and a good conversion
    to TF should deal with the intention behind the elements.

    See `tf.convert.tei` for a production converter of TEI XML to TF.

This converter does not read schemas and has no extra knowledge about the elements.

## Whitespace

Becasue of the lack of schema information we do not know exactly which white-space
is significant. The only thing we do to whitespace is to condense each stretch
of whitespace to a single space.

Whether some of these spaces around tags must be ignored is a matter of further
customization.

This converter limits itself to generating the TF, it does not generated docs and
also the creation of a TF app is out of scope.

## Tasks

We have the following conversion tasks:

1.  `check`: makes and inventory of all XML elements and attributes used.
2.  `convert`: produces actual TF files by converting XML files.
3.  `load`: loads the generated TF for the first time, by which the precomputation
    step is triggered. During precomputation some checks are performed. Once this
    has succeeded, we have a workable Text-Fabric dataset.

Tasks can be run by passing any choice of task keywords to the
`XML.task()` method.

## Flags

We have one flag:

1. `test`: only converts those files in the input that are named in a test set.

The test set is passed as argument to the `XML` constructur.

The `test` flag is passed to the `XML.task()` method.

## Usage

It is intended that you call this converter in a script.

In that script you can define auxiliary Python functions and pass them
to the converter. The `XML` class has some hooks where such functions
can be plugged in.

Here you can also define a test set, in case you want to experiment with the
conversion.

Last, but not least, you can assemble all the input parameters needed to
get the conversion off the ground.

The resulting script will look like this:

``` python

from tf.convert.xml import XML
from tf.core.files import baseNm


TEST_SET = set(
    '''
    aa00.xml
    bb11.xml
    '''.strip().split()

## Essentials

*   Text-Fabric non-slot nodes correspond to XML elements in the source.
*   Text-Fabric node-features correspond to XML attributes.
*   Text-Fabric slot nodes correspond to characters in XML element content.

## Sectioning

The material is divided into two levels of sections, mainly for the purposes
of text display.

It is assumed that the source is a directory consisting of subdirectories
consisting of xml files, the XML files.

1.  Subdirectories and files are sorted in the lexicographic ordering
1.  The subdirectory `__ignore__` is ignored.
1.  For each subdirectory, a section level 1 node will be created, with
    feature `name` containing its name.
1.  For each file in a subdirecotry, a section level 2 node will be created, with
    feature `name` containing its name.


## Elements and attributes

1.  All elements result in nodes whose type is
    exactly equal to the tag name.
1.  These nodes are linked to the slots that are produced when converting the
    content of the corresponding source elements.
1.  Attributes translate into features of the same name; the feature assigns
    the attribute value (as string) to the node that corresponds to the element
    of the attribute.

## Slots

The basic unit is the unicode character.
For each character in the input we make a slot, but the correspondence is not
quite 1-1.

1.  Whitespace is reduced to a single space.
1.  Empty elements will receive one extra slot; this will anchor the element to
    a textual position; the empty slot gets the ZERO-WIDTH-SPACE (Unicode 200B)
    as character value.
1.  Slots get the following features:
    *   `ch`: the character of the slot
    *   `empty`: 1 if the slot has been inserted as an empty slot, no value otherwise.


## Text-formats

Text-formats regulate how text is displayed, and they can also determine
what text is displayed.

We have the following formats:

*   `text-orig-full`: all text

## Simplifications

XML is complicated.

On the other hand, the resulting TF should consist of clearly demarcated node types
and a simple list of features. In order to make that happen, we simplify matters
a bit.

1.  Processing instructions (`<!proc a="b">`) are ignored.
1.  Comments (`<!-- this is a comment -->`) are ignored.
1.  Declarations (`<?xml ...>` `<?xml-model ...>` `<?xml-stylesheet ...>`) are
    read by the parser, but do not leave traces in the TF output.
1.  The atrributes of the root-element are ignored.
1.  Namespaces are read by the parser,
    but only the unqualified names are distinguishable in the output as feature names.
    So if the input has elements `ns1:abb` and `ns2:abb`, we'll see just the node
    type `abb` in the output.

## TF noded and features

(only in as far they are not in 1-1 correspondence with XML elements and attributes)

### node type `folder`

*The type of subfolders of XML documents.*

**Section level 1.**

**Features**

feature | description
--- | ---
`folder` | name of the subfolder

### node type `file`

*The type of individual XML documents.*

**Section level 2.**

**Features**

feature | description
--- | ---
`file` | name of the file, without the `.xml` extension. Other extensions are included.

### node type `char`

*Unicode characters.*

**Slot type.**

The characters of the text of the elements.
Ignorable whitespace has been discarded, and is not present in the TF dataset.
Meaningful whitespace has been condensed to single spaces.

Some empty slots have been inserted to mark the place of empty elements.

**Features**

feature | description
--- | ---
`ch` | the unicode character in that slot. There are also slots
`empty` | whether a slot has been inserted in an empty element

        """Converts XML to TF.

        We adopt a fair bit of "convention over configuration" here, in order to lessen
        the burden for the user of specifying so many details.

        Based on current directory from where the script is called,
        it defines all the ingredients to carry out
        a `tf.convert.walker` conversion of the XML input.

        This function is assumed to work in the context of a repository,
        i.e. a directory on your computer relative to which the input directory
        `xml` and the output directory `tf` exist.

        Your current directory must be somewhere inside

        ```
        ~/backend/org/repo/relative
        ```

        where

        *   `~` is your home directory;
        *   `backend` is an online *backend* name,
            like `github`, `gitlab`, `git.huc.knaw.nl`;
        *   `org` is an organisation, person, or group in the backend;
        *   `repo` is a repository in the `org`.
        *   `relative` is a directory path within the repo (0 or more components)

        This is only about the directory structure on your local computer;
        it is not required that you have online incarnations of your repository
        in that backend.
        Even your local repository does not have to be a git repository.

        The only thing that matters is that the full path to your repo can be parsed
        as a sequence of *home*/*backend*/*org*/*repo*/*relative*.

        Relative to this directory the program expects and creates
        input/output directories.

        ## Input directory

        ### `xml`

        *Location of the XML sources.*

        **If it does not exist, the program aborts with an error.**

        Several levels of subfolders are assumed:

        1.  the version of the source (this could be a date string).
        2.  volumes/collections of documents. The subfolder `__ignore__` is ignored.
        3.  the XML documents themselves

        ## Output directories

        ### `report`

        Directory to write the results of the `check` task to: an inventory
        of elements/attributes encountered, and possible validation errors.
        If the directory does not exist, it will be created.
        The default value is `.` (i.e. the current directory in which
        the script is invoked).

        ### `tf`

        The directory under which the text-fabric output file (with extension `.tf`)
        are placed.
        If it does not exist, it will be created.
        The tf files will be generated in a subdirectory named by a version number,
        passed as `tfVersion`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        sourceVersion: string, optional "0.1"

        testSet: set, optional empty
            A set of file names. If you run the conversion in test mode
            (pass `test` as argument to the `XML.task()` method),
            only the files in the test set are converted.

        generic: dict, optional {}
            Metadata for all generated TF feature.

            If not None, a function that transforms text to text, used
            as a preprocessing step for each input xml file.
