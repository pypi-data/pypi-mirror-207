What is ASTK?
===============

**ASTK** is a command-line software for comprehensive alternative splicing analysis including:
- characterizing distribution and expression patterns of alternative splicing events
- systematically analyzing functional effects of AS events at the gene- and exon-level respectively
- dissecting out splicing-associated sequence features and epigenetic marks
- inferring the splicing regulatory code for each type of AS.
