This program is a simple implementation of the square formula in Python. The square formula calculates the square of the sum of two numbers.

The program consists of two files:

    square_formula.py containing the implementation of the square formula
    test_square_formula.py containing tests for the square formula implementation

To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the program and run the command pytest or python -m unittest.

To use the square formula implementation in your own program, simply import the square_formula function from the square_formula.py file.
