class Perturbator(ABC):
    """
    Abstract perturbator. Perturbators are used to simulate a fictitious effect when running a power analysis.

    The idea is that, when running a power analysis, we split our instances according to a RandomSplitter, and the
    instances that got the treatment, are perturbated with a fictional effect via the Perturbator.

    In order to create your own perturbator, you should create a derived class that implements the perturbate method.
    The perturbate method should add the average effect in the desired way and return the dataframe with the extra average effect,
    without affecting the initial dataframe. Keep in mind to use `df = df.copy()` in the first line of the perturbate method.

    Arguments:
        average_effect: The average effect of the treatment
        treatment: name of the treatment to use as the treated group
        treatment_col: The name of the column that contains the treatment
        treatment: name of the treatment to use as the treated group
