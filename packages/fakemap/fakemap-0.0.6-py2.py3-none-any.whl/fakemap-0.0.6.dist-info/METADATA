- The ability to add basemaps, geojons, shapefiles, and any kind of vector data in both ipyleaflet and Folium
- The ability to add images to the map through ipywidgets
- the ability to overlay raster images on the map
- The ability to display individual bands of a GeoTIFF
- The ability to create a basic spectral profile for the bands of a GeoTIFF
- The ability to print the metadata for a GeoTIFF  

## Examples
- All features include a jupyter notebook that can be opened for a demonstration Click the examples tab to learn more and see the example notebooks.
