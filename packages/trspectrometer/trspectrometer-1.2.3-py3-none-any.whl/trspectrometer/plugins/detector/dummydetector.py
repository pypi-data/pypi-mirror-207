class DummyDetector(Detector):
    """
    A dummy :data:`~trspectrometer.plugins.detector` class which simulates the presence of a real
    detector device.

    It is hard-coded to return 2048 pixels of data in a 400--800 nm range. When start acquisition of
    a fixed number of samples, adjacent spectra are slightly different so that change in absorption
    (Î”A) calculations produce some meaningful results.

    To use this detector driver class, ensure ``"detector"`` is present in the :ref:`configuration
    file`'s ``load=[...]`` list inside the :ref:`plugins` section, then include a section such as
    this in the :ref:`configuration file` under the ``[hardware]`` section:

    .. code-block:: toml

        [[hardware.detector]]
        name = "Detector"
        class = "DummyDetector"
    
    Note that multiple detectors may be added, indicated by the double square brackets around the
    section header. Acquisition methods may then select which chopper entry to use.
