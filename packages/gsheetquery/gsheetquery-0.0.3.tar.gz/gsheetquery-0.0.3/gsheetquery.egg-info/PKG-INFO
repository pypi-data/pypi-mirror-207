## Overview

For small projects, full Python frameworks can be overkill (Django).  Especially if you want code up and running quickly.  Google Sheets can be leveraged as a database and made accessible by GSheetQuery.

This library will allow users to interact with google sheets as a document database similar to MongoDB.

## Install

Install using `pip install gsheetquery` in your preferred command line.  Import to your python files like any other module.

## Quickstart

```python
from gsheetquery import Client, Collection

# Initialize the client object
client = Client()

# Create a new database
database = client.create_database("my_new_database")

# Add a new collection to the database
new_collection = database['new-collection']

# List the collections in the database
collection_names = database.list_collection_names()
print("Collections in the database:", collection_names)

# Add a doc to the collection
new_doc = {"name": "Bob", "age", "30"}
new_collection.insert_one(new_doc)

# Query the collection
new_collection.find_one({"age": "30"})

# Delete the database
client.drop_collection('new-collection')
```
