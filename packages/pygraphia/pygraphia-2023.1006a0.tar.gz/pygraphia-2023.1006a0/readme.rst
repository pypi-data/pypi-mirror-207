``PyGraphia is in early development phase.``

PyGraphia aims to be a minimalist graph library to help you implement graph algorithms out of the box. 

It also comes with its own implementations of few popular graph algorithms. 

The current features are:

- Following graph data types: ``Graph``, ``Vertex``, ``Edge``, ``Walk``, ``Path``
- Following algorithms: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Prim's MST generation
- The ``Graph`` data type` comes with a lot of in-built properties like ``is_connected``, ``is_eulerian`` etc.

Future goals:

- Expand algorithms coverage
- More support for directed graphs
- Thorough testing setup
- Thorough documentation
- CI/CD setup

Currently development time constrainted due to my busy university schedule. Hopefully I will be able to invest more time next month.

Contributors and testers are welcome.
