# PlexPreferNonForcedSubs


## Short description:
This python script will set all movies and shows in your local Plex library to English non forced subtitles by default. The subtitle selections will apply to your Plex profile and be remembered on other devices. This script should work on any OS where Python is installed (Windows, MacOS and Linux etc).

## Long description:
This script was created with the help of [ChatGPT Open AI](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and further edited and completed by me. It uses [Plex Python Api](https://python-plexapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It will set all movies and shows in your local Plex library to English non forced subtitles by default. The subtitle selections will apply to your Plex profile and be remembered on other devices. Assuming your Plex subtitles settings are setup in your server settings Plex will default to Forced Subtitles by default when they are available for a given item. Plex will not allow you to prefer non forced subtitles natively hence why this script was created.

This script is confirmed tested and working. Feel free to use this code for your own purposes. I will be running this code periodically on my home server along with some of my other neat little plex scripts like [Plex Auto Delete](https://github.com/Casvt/Plex-scripts/blob/main/changing_settings/plex_auto_delete.py). Thanks to [all](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75027919/python-script-to-set-all-subtitles-for-movies-shows-in-plex-to-english-non-for) who helped! If you use this script and run into any bugs feel free to open an issue. Cheers!
