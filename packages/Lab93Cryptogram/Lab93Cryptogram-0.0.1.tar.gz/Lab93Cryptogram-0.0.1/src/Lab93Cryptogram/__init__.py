  The CryptographyMethodsAPI class enscapulates methods used for keeping
  secrets in both one-way and two-way forms.

  SHA-256 is delivered in a much simpler syntax than the default method
  utilized by hashlib; the CryptographyMethods.SHA256 object merely
  requires a secret to be hashed and delivers the hexdigest of the
  resulting byte object.

  For two-way secret keeping CryptographyMethods.Encryption and
  CryptographyMethods.Decryption are offered; both of which utilize the
  CryptographyMethods.BuildKey function for locking and unlocking secrets,
  respectively.
