# League Client Live Data Api
An async api wrapper for the [game client api](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#game-client-api) from league of legends.
For every endpoint there is a pydantic BaseModel that represents the data from the response of the request. 
# Setup
## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Plutokekz/LeagueClientLiveDataApi.git
poetry install
```
## Usage

````python
from pathlib import Path

from live_client_data import LeagueClientLiveDataApi


if __name__ == "__main__":
    config_file = Path("config.yaml")
    api = LeagueClientLiveDataApi()
    async def main():
        while True:
            data = await api.event_data()
            print(data)
    api.loop.run_until_complete(main())
````
