# relquant
Relation quantitifcation. Real-world data often doesn't fit into being exactly one type of nicely-defined relation. Popular classes of relations often have universal quantifiers that measurement error can violate. But sometimes data are 'close to' nicely defined relations, and with a little bit of help that can be elucidated.
