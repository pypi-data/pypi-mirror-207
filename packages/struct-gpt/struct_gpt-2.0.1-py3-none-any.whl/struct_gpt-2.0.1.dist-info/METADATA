# struct-gpt


[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/knowsuchagency/struct-gpt/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=TMUQNTCTDI)](https://codecov.io/gh/knowsuchagency/struct-gpt)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/struct-gpt.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/struct-gpt/)

## Features

* Easy creation of custom models using the OpenAI API
* Integration with Pydantic for model validation and serialization
* Flexible configuration with retries and temperature settings

## Usage

`pip install struct-gpt`

---

Template variables in the class' docstring are replaced with the keyword arguments passed to `create`.

```python
from struct_gpt import OpenAiBase
from pydantic import Field


class SentimentSchema(OpenAiBase):
    """
    Determine the sentiment of the given text:

    {content}
    """

    sentiment: str = Field(description="Either -1, 0, or 1.")


print(SentimentSchema.from_openai(content="I love pizza!").json())
```
outputs:
```json
{
  "sentiment": "1"
}
```

Your classes can reference one another. You can also use the `OpenAiMixin` to add functionality to your own classes.

```python
from struct_gpt import OpenAiBase, OpenAiMixin
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel
from typing import Mapping


class SentimentSchema(OpenAiBase):
    """
    Determine the sentiment of the given text:

    {content}
    """

    sentiment: str = Field(description="Either -1, 0, or 1.")


# you can use the OpenAiMixin to add functionality to your own classes
class SentimentAnalysis(BaseModel, OpenAiMixin):
    """
    Determine the sentiment of each word in the following: {text}

    Also determine the overall sentiment of the text and who the narrator is.
    """

    words_to_sentiment: Mapping[str, SentimentSchema]
    overall_sentiment: SentimentSchema
    narrator: str


print(
    SentimentAnalysis.from_openai(
        text="As president, I loved the beautiful scenery, but the long hike was exhausting."
    ).json(indent=2)
)
```

  "words_to_sentiment": {

      "sentiment": "-1"
    }
  },
  "overall_sentiment": {
    "sentiment": "0"
  },
  "narrator": "president"
}
```

</details>

## Improving reliability with examples

`create` can accept a list of examples to guide the model and improve its accuracy. Each example is a dictionary containing an `input` and `output` key. The `input` is the user message and the `output` is the expected assistant message, which should be a valid instance of the schema serialized as a string.

In this example, we are providing the model with examples of positive and negative sentiments:

```python
from struct_gpt import OpenAiBase
from pydantic import Field


class SentimentSchema(OpenAiBase):
    """
    Determine the sentiment of the given text:

    {content}
    """

    sentiment: str = Field(description="Either -1, 0, or 1.")


examples = [
    {
        "input": "this library is neat!",
        "output": SentimentSchema(sentiment="1").json(),
    },
    {
        "input": "don't touch that",
        "output": SentimentSchema(sentiment="-1").json(),
    },
]

print(SentimentSchema.from_openai(content="I love pizza!", examples=examples).json())
```
outputs:
```json
{
  "sentiment": "1"
}
```
