# Cypyonate
Cypyonate is an extendable command-line injector built entirely in Python. It is named after testosterone cypionate, an injectable form of the hormone.

# Features
Cypyonate currently has 5 injection forms which can be selected with the `--form` argument
- LoadLibrary DLL Injection
- Shellcode Injection
- Manual Map DLL Injection
- Thread Hijack LoadLibrary Injection (Only seems to work ~90% of the time)
- Early Bird APC Shellcode Injection
- Early Bird APC DLL Injection

More methods can be added with relative ease. See [Adding Injection Methods](https://github.com/Scags/cypyonate#adding-injection-methods).

# Installation
### Requirements
Latest tested with Python 3.11.0

The following Python packages are required by Cypyonate and can be install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- pefile
- pywin32
- colorama
- setuptools

### Installation Process
```
PS C:\Dev> git clone https://github.com/Scags/Cypyonate.git
PS C:\Dev> pip install .\Cypyonate\
//OR
PS C:\Dev> cd .\Cypyonate\
PS C:\Dev\Cypyonate> py .\setup.py install
```

### Installing Multiple Architectures
Cypyonate cannot execute under a different architecture than what it was installed with. If you want to install Cypyonate for x86, you must download the x86 version of Python, then run `pip install` from that Python version.

Cypyonate changes its command depending on the architecture of the Python installation that installs it. If running x64, the command is `cypy`. If running x86, the command is `cypy32`. Assure that your Python installation's `Scripts/` directory is added to your PATH.

# Adding Injection Methods
Create a new .py file, import the main cypyonate module, and create a class that inherits from cypyonate.Module. Overload the `inject()` function and implement your code.

You *must* use a relative import like below, as installing the module with place it within the "modules" subfolder in the project.

```py
from .. import cypyonate as cypy

class MyInjection(cypy.Module):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__(name="My Injection", frmat="myinjection", desc="My custom injection method")

  def add_to_argparse(self, parser):
    # If you want to add options to the "cypy" command argument handler
    pass

  def inject(self, handler: cypy.Cypyonate, target: str, payload: str, verbose: bool):
    # Run code here
    pass
```

To finalize adding your module, enter the command `cypy --install myfile.py`. This will copy the file to the project modules folder.

# Reflective Injection
*New with V1.3*

Cypyonate is capable of performing reflective injections.

This is currently supported by the current forms:
- Shellcode Injection
- Manual Map DLL Injection
- Early Bird APC Shellcode Injection

To perform a reflective injection, simply pass a base64 encoded string as the payload and add the `-r` argument.
