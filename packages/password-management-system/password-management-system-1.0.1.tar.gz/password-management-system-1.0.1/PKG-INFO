## Security
The app doesn't store user password but use a hashed version to login the user, a random secret key get generated when a user signup and it's encrypted using user password, all passwords belong to that user will get encrypted by this key.

as long as user is logged out nothing can get his passwords without the user password.

python [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) package is used for encryption.
