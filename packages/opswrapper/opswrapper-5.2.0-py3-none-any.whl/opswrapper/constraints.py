    Notes
    -----
    The single-point constraints when using the transformation method are done
    directly. The matrix equation is not manipulated to enforce them, rather the
    trial displacements are set directly at the nodes at the start of each
    analysis step.

    Great care must be taken when multiple constraints are being enforced as the
    transformation method does not follow constraints:

    1. If a node is fixed, constrain it with the 'fix' command and 'equalDOF' or
       other type of constraint.
    2. If multiple nodes are constrained, make sure that the retained node is
       not constrained in any other constraint.

        Multiplier for multi-point constraints.

    Notes
    -----
    The Lagrange multiplier method introduces new unknowns to the system of
    equations. The diagonal part of the system corresponding to these new
    unknowns is 0.0. This ensures that the system IS NOT symmetric positive

    Notes
    -----
    The degree to which the constraints are enforced is dependent on the penalty
    values chosen. Problems can arise if these values are too small (constraint
    not enforced strongly enough) or too large (problems associated with
    conditioning of the system of equations).
