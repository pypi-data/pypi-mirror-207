## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform boundary Provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 1.0` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by generating the [provider constructs manually](https://cdk.tf/imports).

These are the upstream dependencies:

* [Terraform CDK](https://cdk.tf)
* [Terraform boundary Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-boundary)
* [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.

## Features / Issues / Bugs
