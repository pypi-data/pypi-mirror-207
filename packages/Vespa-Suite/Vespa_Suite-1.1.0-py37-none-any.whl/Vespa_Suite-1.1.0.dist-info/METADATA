Vespa stands for "Versatile Simulation, Pulses and Analysis". The Vespa 
package is an integrated, open-source, platform for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 
research and data analysis. Applications in the Vespa package include: 

Simulation - for spectral simulation (using the PyGAMMA/GAMMA library)
Pulse - for RF pulse design and analysis
DataSim - used to create synthetic MRS data sets from Simulation results 
Analysis - spectral data processing and analysis

The Vespa project addresses previous software limitations, including: non-standard data access,
closed source multiple language software that complicate algorithm extension and comparison,
lack of integration between programs for sharing prior information, and incomplete or missing
documentation and educational content.

These applications can be run separately but communicate among themselves via a shared
database of objects/results.  One example of inter-application sharing might be that
Simulation would make use of an RF pulse designed in Pulse application to create a more
realistic MR simulation.
