    **How does it work ?**

        :alt: image explaining the Appollo-cli and Appollo-Remote architecture
        :align: center

    The Appollo tool is composed of :

            - *Appollo-Remote* : The pre-configured build machines which handle the setup, build and release of your app
            - *Appollo-cli* : The CLI command line that works as an interface to start Appollo-Remote build machines

    This reference guide only covers the Appollo-cli features.

    .. note:: Appollo-Remotes are MacOS build machines on which the flutter build of your application is executed.
