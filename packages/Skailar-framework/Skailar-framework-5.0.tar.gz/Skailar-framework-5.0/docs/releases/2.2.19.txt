Skailar 2.2.19 release notes
===========================

*February 19, 2021*

Skailar 2.2.19 fixes a security issue in 2.2.18.

CVE-2021-23336: Web cache poisoning via ``skailar.utils.http.limited_parse_qsl()``
=================================================================================

Skailar contains a copy of :func:`urllib.parse.parse_qsl` which was added to
backport some security fixes. A further security fix has been issued recently
such that ``parse_qsl()`` no longer allows using ``;`` as a query parameter
separator by default. Skailar now includes this fix. See :bpo:`42967` for
further details.
