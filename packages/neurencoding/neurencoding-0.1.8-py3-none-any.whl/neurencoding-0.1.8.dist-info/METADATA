# Neurencoding

Neurencoding is a python package for implementing encoding models of single-unit activity for (at the moment) units recorded using electrophysiology. This package provides tools for expressing single-unit firing as a function of many external variables, such as task-related events and values.

This is the package used for the International Brain Lab (IBL) brain-wide map paper.

## Getting started

### Installation

In order to install `neurencoding`, please use pip to install the package in your choice of python environment (e.g. using virtualenv or Anaconda):

```
pip install neurencoding
```

### Loading in data

TBD

## Source work

All work based on code from pillowlab/neuroGLM, translated and extended.
