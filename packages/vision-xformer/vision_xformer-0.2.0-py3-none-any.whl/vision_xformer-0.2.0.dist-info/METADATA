## Vision Xformers: Efficient Attention for Image Classification

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15833382/172207987-e07bb02b-4a1e-430c-a1bf-bc78af87976b.png)


We use Linear Attention mechanisms to replace quadratic attention in ViT for image classification. We show that models using linear attention and CNN embedding layers need less parameters and low GPU requirements for achieving good accuracy. These improvements can be used to democratize the use of transformers by practitioners who are limited by data and GPU.

Hybrid ViX uses convolutional layers instead of linear layer for generating embeddings

Rotary Postion Embedding (RoPE) is also used in our models instead of 1D learnable position embeddings

Nomenclature:
We replace the X in ViX with the starting alphabet of the attention mechanism used
Eg. When we use Performer in ViX, we replace the X with P, calling it ViP (Vision Performer)

'Hybrid' prefix is used in models which uses convolutional layers instead of linear embeddding layer. 

We have added RoPE in the title of models which used Rotary Postion Embedding

The code for using all for these models for classification of CIFAR 10/Tiny ImageNet dataset is provided

from vision_xformer import ViN

model = ViN(
    image_size = 32,
    patch_size = 1,
    num_classes = 10,             
    dim = 128,  
    depth = 4,             
    heads = 4,      
    mlp_dim = 256,
    num_landmarks = 256,
    pool = 'cls',
    channels = 3,
    dropout = 0.,
    emb_dropout = 0.
    dim_head = 32

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)

preds = model(img) # (1, 10)
```

#### Vision Performer (ViP)

```python

    dim = 128,  
    depth = 4,             
    heads = 4,      
    mlp_dim = 256,
    dropout = 0.25,
    dim_head = 32
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)

preds = model(img) # (1, 10)
```

#### Vision Linformer (ViL)

```python
import torch, vision_xformer
from vision_xformer import ViL

model = ViL(
    image_size = 32,

    num_classes = 10,             
    dim = 128,  
    depth = 4,             
    heads = 4,      
    mlp_dim = 256,
    dropout = 0.25,
    dim_head = 32
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)

preds = model(img) # (1, 10)
```
