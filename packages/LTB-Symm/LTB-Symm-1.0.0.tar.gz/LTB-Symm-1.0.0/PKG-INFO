        # LTB-Symm
        
        LTB-Symm is a publicly available code that does two things: **large
        scale tight-binding** (LTB) calculation of 2D materials, and checks
        **topological symmetries** (Symm) of their wave functions.
        
        ## Who benefits
        
        LTB-Symm is an ideal choice for researchers looking for a ready-to-use,
        easy-to-modify, and MPI-implemented TB code for large scale 2D
        structures. Up to 1 (0.1) Milions atoms for limited (vast) K-points, is
        (easily) managable.
        
        Specially communities who deal with twisted bilayer/multilayer graphene.
        
        All input needed are:  
        1.  Coordinate of atoms/orbitals, e.g. lammpstrj, XYZ
        2.  Functional form of Hamiltoninan
        
        And possible outputs are:  
        -   Bands structure,
        -   Density of States,
        -   Check topological symmetries of wave functions.
        -   Shape of the wavefunction
        
        ## Bold features
        
        -   MPI implemented, able to run on HPC clusters.
        -   Object Oriented, easy to modify for multi purpose.
        -   Efficient, calculate only a few energy levels that are needed.
        -   Ideal for 2D materials, e.g. graphene.
        -   Many routings are automated.
        -   The only open-source code that we know of which is able to investigate group symmetries in this way.
