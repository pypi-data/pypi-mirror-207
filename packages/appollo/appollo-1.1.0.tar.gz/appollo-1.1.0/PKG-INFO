    **A tool for developers by developers**

------------
Installation
------------
Appollo is a CLI utility developed in Python. It is easily installed with
pip.

.. code-block::

    pip install appollo

-----
Usage
-----
To start using Appollo simply run :code:`appollo` in your console.

Start by creating an account

.. code-block::

    appollo signup

Your Appollo account is now created and you can either start a build machine in configuration mode : to configure XCode or test your app in the iOS simulator.

.. code-block::

    appollo build start --build-type configuration


Or you can build an IPA or release your app by linking your Apple Developer Account to Appollo and creating an app identifier

.. code-block::

    appollo apple add --apple-id APPLE_TEAM_ID --name TEXT --key-id APPLE_KEY_ID --issuer-id APPLE_ISSUER_ID --private-key LOCATION_APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY
    appollo app mk --name MY_APP_NAME --bundle-id COM.COMPANY.APP_NAME 

To create the IPA to install on a physical device for testing purposes

.. code-block::

    appollo build start --build-type ad-hoc
    appollo build ipa

To publish directly to the App Store

.. code-block::

    appollo build start --build-type publication

Your build failed ? No worries, you can check the logs with

.. code-block::

    appollo build logs

About
-----
**Our mission is to reduce the time it takes to setup, build and release Flutter
apps on iOS to the bare minimum.**

The tool allows developers working alone or in teams and on
multiple OS (Linux, Windows, MacOS) to build and publish their apps easily
to the app store.

**What can Appollo be used for ?**

#. It allows you to setup the XCode project on a remote MacOS machine if you do not own one.
#. It manages common iOS specific settings for your team : certificates, devices, provisioning profiles, bundle IDs, Xcode configuration files, ...
#. It builds your Flutter app on remote iOS machines.
#. It hosts the iOS app artifacts or publish them to the App Store.
