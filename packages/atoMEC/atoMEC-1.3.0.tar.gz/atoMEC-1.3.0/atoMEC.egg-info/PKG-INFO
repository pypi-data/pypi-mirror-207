atoMEC is a python-based average-atom code for simulations of high energy density phenomena such as in warm dense matter.
It is designed as an open-source and modular python package.

atoMEC uses Kohn-Sham density functional theory, in combination with an average-atom approximation,
to solve the electronic structure problem for single-element materials at finite temperature.

More information on the average-atom methodology and Kohn-Sham density functional theory can be found (for example) in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09928) and references therein.

This repository is structured as follows:
```
├── atoMEC : source code
├── docs : sphinx documentation
├── examples : useful examples to get you started with the package
└── tests : test scripts used during development, will hold tests for CI in the future
```


## Installation

First, clone the atoMEC repository and ``cd`` into the main directory.

* Recommended : using [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

  This route is recommended because `pipenv` automatically creates a virtual environment and manages dependencies.

  1. First, install `pipenv` if it is not already installed, for example via `pip install pipenv` (or see [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) for    installation instructions)
  2. Next, install `atoMEC`'s dependencies with `pipenv install` (use `--dev` option to install the test dependencies in the same environment)
  3. Use `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment and install atoMEC with `pip install atoMEC` (for developers: `pip install -e .`)
  4. Now run scripts from inside the `atoMEC` virtual environment, e.g. `python examples/simple.py`

* Run the tests (see Testing section below) and report any failures (for example by raising an issue)

**Please note**: atoMEC does not yet support Windows installation. This is due to the dependency on `pylibxc` which currently lacks Windows support.

## Running
You can familiarize yourself with the usage of this package by running the example scripts in `examples/`.

## Contributing to atoMEC
We welcome your contributions, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to the code:
* In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `develop` and merge requests should be to `develop`
* Please choose a descriptive branch name
* Merges from `develop` to `master` will be done after prior consultation of the core development team
* Merges from `develop` to `master` are only done for code releases. This way we always have a clean `master` that reflects the current release
* Code should be formatted using [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) style

## Testing
* First, install the test requirements (if not already installed in the virtual env with `pipenv install --dev`):
```sh
# activate environment first (optional)
$ pipenv shell

# install atoMEC as editable project in current directory (for developers)
$ pip install -e .[tests]

# alternatively install package from PyPI with test dependencies
$ pip install atoMEC[tests]
```

* To run the tests:
```sh
$ pytest --cov=atoMEC --random-order tests/
```

### Build documentation locally (for developers)

Install the prerequisites:
```sh
$ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

1. Change into `docs/` folder.
2. Run `make apidocs`.
3. Run `make html`. This creates a `_build` folder inside `docs`. You may also want to use `make html SPHINXOPTS="-W"` sometimes. This treats warnings as errors and stops the output at first occurrence of an error (useful for debugging rST syntax).
4. Open `docs/_build/html/index.html`.
5. `make clean` if required (e.g. after fixing errors) and building again.
