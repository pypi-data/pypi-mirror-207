    Configuration
        The configuration is a set of parameters that will define the level for each
        noise type in a nested dictionary. The configuration is a hierarchical structure
        and values are specific to each dataset, column, and noise type.

    Datasets
        Datasets contain un-noised data will be noised and returned to the
        user with errors at a level provided by the configuration.
        The noised data will be output in format specific to the dataset type,
        eg a census or tax form.

    Entity resolution (ER)
        The task of identifying the unique entities associated with a set of records,
        where multiple records may refer to the same entity.
        Also called "record linkage," among other names.

    Noise functions
        Functions that will be applied to datasets at a row or column level to apply
        errors or mistakes in the data to replicate realistic challenges in personal
        record linkage.

    Probabilistic record linkage (PRL)
        Entity resolution ("record linkage") methods that internally use probabilities of
        some kind to represent uncertainty about which records belong to which entities.

    Record linkage
        Another term for entity resolution.

    Simulant
        A simulated person represented in a pseudopeople-generated dataset.
