class MisraGriesSketch:
    """
    The Misra-Gries sketch is a deterministic data structure
    that serves as a frequency table of events in a stream of data.
    
    It uses a dictionary to map events to frequencies and only uses
    sub-linear space, at the expense of undercounting some events due to
    frequency threshold.

    The Misra-Gries algorithm was invented in 1982 by Jayadev Misra and
    David Gries and described by them in a paper.
