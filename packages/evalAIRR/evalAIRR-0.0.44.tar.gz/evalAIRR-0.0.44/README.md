# evalAIRR

A tool that allows comparison of real and simulated AIRR datasets by providing different statistical indicators and dataset visualizations in one report.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual python environment to run evalAIRR if another python environment is used. Here is a quick guide on how you can set up a virtual environment:

`https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments`

### Install using pip

Run this command to install the evalAIRR package:

`pip install evalairr`

## Quickstart

evalAIRR uses a YAML file for configuration. If you are unfamiliar with how YAML files are structured, read this guide to the syntax:

`https://docs.fileformat.com/programming/yaml/#syntax`

This is the stucture of a sample report configuration file you can use to start off with (it is included in the repository location ./yaml_files/quickstart.yaml):

```
datasets:
  real:
    path: ./data/real_data.csv
  sim:
    path: ./data/sim_data.csv
reports:
  feature_based:
    report1:
      features:
        - CAS
        - SAS
      report_types:
        - ks
        - distr_densityplot
        - distance
        - statistics
  observation_based:
    report1:
      observations:
        - all
      report_types:
        - distr_densityplot
  general:
    feat_mean_vs_variance:
    obs_mean_vs_variance:
    pca_2d_feat:
    pca_2d_obs:
    corr_feat_hist:
    corr_obs_hist:
output:
  path: ./output/report.html
```

This report will process the two provided datasets (real and simulated) with encoded kmer data, and create an HTML report with multiple report types. These include feature-based report types - Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (indicated by report type `ks`), a feature distribution density plot (indicated by report type `distr_densityplot`), Euclidean distance measures (indicated by report type `distance`) and descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance and standard deviation)(indicated by report type `statistics`) for the features `CAS` and `SAS`. It will then export the report to the path `./output/report.html`. It will also create an observation-based report with the feature distribution density plot (indicated by report type `distr_densityplot`) for all observations (indicated by keyword `all` in the observation list). Finally, these general reports will be generated: feature mean compared with feature variance (indicated by report type `feat_mean_vs_variance`), observation mean compared with observation variance (indicated by report type `obs_mean_vs_variance`), two dimensional representation of all features using PCA (indicated by report type `pca_2d_feat`), two dimensional representation of all observations using PCA (indicated by report type `pca_2d_obs`), feature correlation coefficient distribution histogram (indicated by report type `corr_feat_hist`) and an observation correlation coefficient distribution histogram (indicated by report type `corr_obs_hist`). More details on what reports can be created can be found in the _YAML Configuration Guidelines_ section.

The repository contains sample datafiles and a quickstart YAML configuration files. You can clone the repository and run evalAIRR within it to use sample data.

Within the cloned repository run the command:

`evalairr -i ./yaml_files/quickstart.yaml`

The report will be generated in the specified output path in the configuration file or, if a specific path is not provided, in `<CURRENT_DIRECTORY>/output/report.html`. The report is exported in the HTML format.

## YAML Configuration Guidelines

The configuration YAML file consists of 3 main sections: `datasets`, `reports` and `output`.

### Datasets

In the `datasets` section, you have to provide paths to a real and a simulated datasets that you are comparing. CSV files with encoded kmer data are supported. This can be done by specifying the file path of each file in the `path` variable under the sections `real` and `sim` respectively. Here is an example of how a configured `datasets` section looks like:

```
datasets:
  real:
    path: ./data/real_data.csv
  sim:
    path: ./data/sim_data.csv
```

### Reports

In the `reports` section, you can provide the list of report types you want to create and their parameters. There are three types of report groups depending on the different parameters: `feature_based`, `observation_based` and `generic`. Here is the list of reports you can create that compare the features of the real dataset with the simulated dataset:

### Output

An optional section where you can specify the file path of the generated report. The default path of the generated report is `<CURRENT_DIRECTORY>/output/report.html`. The report is exported in the HTML format. If you declare the path as 'NONE', the report will not be created.

An example output section:

```
output:
  path: ./output/report.html
```

For example, this output section would result in a report file not being created:

```
output:
  path: NONE
```
