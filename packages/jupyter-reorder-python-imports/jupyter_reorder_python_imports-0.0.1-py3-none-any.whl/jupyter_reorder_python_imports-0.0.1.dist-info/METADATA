# jupyter-reorder-python-imports

[reorder-python-imports](https://github.com/asottile/reorder-python-imports) is a great library. Now availble in Jupyter notebook and lab.

## What does it do?
Once loaded, automatically format python imports according to reorder-python-imports using their [formatting methods](https://github.com/asottile/reorder-python-imports#what-does-it-do).

## Quickstart
`python -m pip install jupyter-reorder-python-imports`.

Import into Jupyter using two methods:
```
%load_ext jupyter_reorder_python_imports
```
Or,
```
import jupyter-reorder-python-imports

jupyter-reorder-python-imports.load()
```
The latter method allows for specifying `min_python_version`, which is a tuple specifying the minimum python version to be used for reordering imports. For example, `min_python_version=(3,9)` specifies that the minimum python version is 3.9, and `min_python_version=(3,)` specifies python 3.
```
import jupyter-reorder-python-imports

jupyter-reorder-python-imports.load(min_python_version=(3,9))
```
