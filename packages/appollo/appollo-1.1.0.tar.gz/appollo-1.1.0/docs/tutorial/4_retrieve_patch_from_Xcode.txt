4. How to retrieve your updates from Appollo-Remote locally
===========================================================

Once you are satisfied with the configuration, you have two possibilities to retrieve the changes you made in Appollo locally.

    1. **If you use Git** for your project the easiest is to use ``appollo build patch`` which will `Retrieve changes with a patch file`_.
    2. Otherwise, you can `Retrieve changes by downloading the project files`_ locally with the command ``appollo build download``.


Retrieve changes with a patch file
----------------------------------

**If you are using git** and decided to retrieve a git patch containing all the changes you made to Xcode.

First, make sure your build is stopped.

You can check the list of your ongoing builds with ``appollo build ls`` and the ``--all`` option to see all your other older builds.

Stopping a build manually is possible by using the command ``appollo build stop`` and selecting the build you want to stop.

When your build is stopped, you can create the patch using ``appollo build patch``.

By default, the file is called **appollo.patch** and is located in your app folder.

To apply the changes, use the git command ``git am appollo.patch``.

.. tip::

  Use ``--help`` to see the options of a command. For exemple, with ``appollo build patch`` you have options to name the file of your patch.

Retrieve changes by downloading the project files
-------------------------------------------------
First, make sure your build is stopped.

You can check the list of your ongoing builds with ``appollo build ls`` and the ``--all`` option to see all your other older builds.

Stopping a build manually is possible by using the command ``appollo build stop`` and selecting the build you want to stop.

When your build is stopped, you can get your files as a zip file by using ``appollo build download``.

Unzip the files and you get the last version of your source code as edited in XCode.
