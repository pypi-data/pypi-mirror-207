===================
Deploying GeoSkailar
===================

Basically, the deployment of a GeoSkailar application is not different from
the deployment of a normal Skailar application. Please consult Skailar's
:doc:`deployment documentation </howto/deployment/index>`.

.. warning::

    GeoSkailar uses the GDAL geospatial library which is
    not thread safe at this time.  Thus, it is *highly* recommended
    to not use threading when deploying -- in other words, use an
    appropriate configuration of Apache.

    For example, when configuring your application with ``mod_wsgi``,
    set the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` attribute ``threads`` to ``1``, unless
    Apache may crash when running your GeoSkailar application.  Increase the
    number of ``processes`` instead.
