Example of using OpenAI with PyQt (Python cross-platform GUI toolkit)



This shows an example of using OpenAI with PyQt as a chatbot.



Even though this project has become too huge to be called an 'example'.



The major advantage of this package is that you don't need to know other language aside from Python.



If you want to study openai with Python-only good old desktop software, this is for you.



The OpenAI model this package uses is the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5">gpt-3.5-turbo</a> model(which is nearly as functional as <b>ChatGPT</b>) by default. You can use gpt-4 as well.



Image generation feature available since v0.0.16. You can see the detail in <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction">official OpenAI</a> site. Currently this feature is very basic now.



This is using <b>sqlite</b> as a database.



You can select the model at the right side bar.



An internet connection is required.



## Contact

You can join pyqt-openai's <a href="https://discord.gg/cHekprskVE">Discord Server</a> to have a conversation about it or AI-related stuff ðŸ™‚



## Note

Some of the features are still being tested.



## Feature

* basically this is <b>desktop application version of ChatGPT</b>

  * text streaming (enable by default, you can disable it)

  * AI remembers past conversation

* support GPT-4

* you can save the conversation history with sqlite database

* support prompt generator

* support image generation with DALL-E

* you can test any models, including gpt3.5

* you can run this in background application

* you can make window stack on top or control its transparency



## Requirements

* qtpy - the package allowing you to write code that works with both PyQt and PySide

* PyQt5 >= 5.14 or PySide6

* openai



## Preview

This is using GPT-3.5 turbo model by default.

### Prompt Generator

So sorry to weak preview, but i have a lot of idea about this prompt generator! Just wait. 



## How to play

1. git clone ~

2. from the root directory, type "cd pyqt_openai"

3. You should put your api key in the line edit. You can get it in <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">official site</a> of openai. Sign up and log in before you get it. <b>By the way, this is free trial, not permanently free. See <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview">this</a> after you have logged in.</b>



Be sure, this is a very important API key that belongs to you only, so you should remember it and keep it secure.



4. python main.py



If installation doesn't work, check the troubleshooting below.



## Troubleshooting

If you see this error while installing the openai package

```

subprocess-exited-with-error

```

you can shout a curse word and just download the package itself from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai/#files">pypi</a>. 



Unzip it, access the package directory, type 

```

python setup.py install

```



That will install the openai.



## TODO list

* support Stable Diffusion

* show the explanation of every model and terms related to AI (e.g. temperature, topp..)

* save conversation history with other format (xlsx, csv, etc.)

* tokenizer

* highlight the source (optional, eventually)

* support multiple language

* use SQLAlchemy (maybe not)

* show reason when the chat input is disabled for some reasons

* add the basic example sources of making deep learning model with PyTorch (eventually)
