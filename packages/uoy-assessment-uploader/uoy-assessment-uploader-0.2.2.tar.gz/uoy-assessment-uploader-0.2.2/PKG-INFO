# uoy_assessment_uploader

## Install
1. When you have Python and Pip ready, it's as easy as:
   ```shell
   python -m pip install "uoy-assessment-uploader"
   ```
   - or, directly from the repo:
      ```shell
      python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/joelsgp/uoy-assessment-uploader"
      ```
2. You need the Chrome browser installed. Sorry!
    - I need a cookie management feature Firefox doesn't have.
    - Chromium and Ungoogled Chrome should work too.

Like this:
- ```shell
  python -m uoy_assessment_uploader --help
  ```
  or
- ```shell
  uoy-assessment-uploader --help
