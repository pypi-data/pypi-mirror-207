I haven't written a single line of this code, and I don't know who wrote it. But I know that it is pretty useful if you need details about your network connection - Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

From the source code:

```python

#  For the sake of humanity here's a python script retrieving
#  ip information of the network interfaces.
#
#  Pay some tribute to my soul cause I lost a few years on this one
#
#  based on code from jaraco and many other attempts
#  on internet.
#  Fixed by <@gpotter2> from scapy's implementation to
#  add IPv6 support + fix structures
