## Typing stubs for flake8-simplify

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `flake8-simplify` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`flake8-simplify`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/flake8-simplify. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
